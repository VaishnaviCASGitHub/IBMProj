IBM Cloud Project on the title "SMART RAILWAY SOLUTIONS"

As trains are one of the most preferred modes of transportation among middle class and impoverished people as it attracts for its amenities. Simultaneously there is an increase at risk from thefts and accidents like chain snatching, derailment, fire accident. In order to avoid or in better words to stop all such brutality we came up with a solution by providing an application which can be accessed by the user after booking their tickets. With a single click this app addresses issues by sending a text message to TC and RPF as an alert. In our project we use Node-Red service, app-development, IBM cloud platform to store passenger data.
